#+title: Conventions

* Testing
- Add a description to the assert statements in the unit tests
  - Example
    #+begin_src rust
    create_user_dir(&test_path).await?;
    assert!(test_path.exists(), "create user store directory");
    #+end_src
* Documentation
The basic structure of item documentation should follow:
#+begin_src rust
/// Brief sentence explaining what it is
///
/// More detaile description (optional).
///
/// * `foo` - Text about foo.
/// * `bar` - Text about bar.
///
/// # Errors (optional)
/// If the function returns a Result, describing the kinds of errors that might occur and what
/// conditions might cause those errors.
#+end_src
- A separate ~Returns~ section or similar is usually not necessary.

Explanatory code comments should be plentiful. It should be assumed that the
code is not touched for a long time and whoever is working on it needs guidance.
Thus, the comments should explain what is happening and why.
* General guidelines
Try to follow the principle: Make it work, make it correct, make it fast.
